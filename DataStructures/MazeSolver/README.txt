Homework 2 - Solving a maze
By Josh Fermin

- Current status of program, there are no bugs
- note: there is a semi colon in the header file before ;class maze
	- Usually this is not needed, but for my program to compile this must
	- be included
	
- The program uses recursion to check for both a '-' and a '$' char to 
	solve the maze.
	
	
- Worked with Aaron and Louis
